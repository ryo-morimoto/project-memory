## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of project-memory seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT open a public issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to the project maintainers through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. Or create a private security advisory on GitHub

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide a detailed response within 7 days
- We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing with you

### Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue
- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have released a fix
- Do not attempt to exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it

### Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help keep project-memory safe. With your permission, we will acknowledge your contribution in our security advisories and release notes.

## Security Considerations

Since project-memory handles knowledge data that may contain sensitive information:

- Be cautious about what data you store in memory entries
- Consider using environment-specific configurations for sensitive projects
- Review the data being indexed and stored
